# Ultimate-Lua-Tester
What is this?
You know how there is "print('Hello World')" right? To test your script and stuff? Well I made it more unique, complicated, and longer.
Why?
I was bored and I just opened VS-Code and do random stuff.

Enter the Ultimate Lua Tester, This code with a bunch of nonsense will make your console go through a rough time going in tests on how it works.
Purpose? To see if your lua files have errors, yeah. Real Nonsense.
